			<p id="bio">One of the oldest reptillians to walk the Earth,
				the Hydra is commonly known to cause terror to regional
				fishing expeditions, oceanic industry, and Greek heroes.
				Thanks to a series of genetic mutations, this creature is
				impervious to most mortal instruments of death. It is not
			  currently known how many Hydra exist in the wild, but estimations
				lead some to believe this elusive beast is responsible for most of
				the predation in the world's oceans.</p>
